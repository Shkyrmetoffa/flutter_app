E140 (i) and E140 (ii) can be used in cosmetics and medicines, as well as in food products. When used commercially, chlorophyllins and chlorophyllins tend to be extracted from plants such as alfalfa, grass and nettles. These dyes are soluble in water, although their intensity can disappear with time. If 100% powder is used it is Halal. Sometimes water or vegetable oil is used as a solvent, then Halal. But sometimes alcohol is used, in this case it is Haram.

E141 (i) includes chlorophyll copper complexes. It is divided into 2 classes: ul  li E141 (i): Clorophyll Cupric Complex li  li E141 (ii): Cupric Complex of Chlorophyllin li ul These coloring agents provide a tone very similar to olive green. However, E141 (i) and E141 (ii) are more stable forms than E140 (i) and E140 (ii) because the magnesium ion in chlorophyll in E140 (i) and E140 (ii) is replaced by copper in E141 ( i) and E141 (ii). E141 (i) is soluble in water, while E141 (ii) is not soluble in water but is soluble in oil. The copper content of the dyes can be released when heated, but must not reach dangerous levels.
